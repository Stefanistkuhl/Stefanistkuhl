I suck at codeing.  

#### Stuff I use  
- Go  
  - whenver i write code that gets deployed in a container  
- Python  
  - small automations and anything that isn't the above
- Java  
  - Forced by school :(
- Docker

#### Stuff I've done  
```diff
+ Wasting time
- Being actually productive
```  

#### Ok, but what did/do I actually do?  
- GNS3v3 API Wrapper to automate setting up exercises in it for my school [gns3-api-util](https://github.com/Stefanistkuhl/gns3-api-util)
- silly dashboard for my homelab [uwud](https://github.com/Stefanistkuhl/uwud)
- Discord bot to add emotes from 7tv to my discord server [bubuKabum](https://github.com/Stefanistkuhl/bubuKabum)
- Nothing more, lol  

#### What do I want to do?  
- Play more CTFs and create a write-ups on my [blog](https://stefanistkuhl.github.io/)
- Build a DIY shitty but working container orchestrator
- Overengineer my horribly engineered emote bot as much as possible because why not
