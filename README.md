I like to overengineer my code.  

And I might have a *small* Docker/containerization and Go addiction, but it's totally not real and nothing to worry about.  

#### Technologies I use  
- Go  
  - For backend code  
- Python  
  - For small automations or general code that isn't backend  
- Java  
  - Forced by school  
- Docker  
  - To package my code and deploy it-I *might* have an addiction  

#### Stuff I've done  
```diff
+ Wasting time overengineering projects and adding Docker to them
- Being actually productive
```  

#### Ok, but what did/do I actually do?  
- GNS3v3 API Wrapper to automate setting up exercises in it for my school [gns3-api-util](https://github.com/Stefanistkuhl/gns3-api-util)
- Built a Discord bot with discord.js and a Go backend for handling requests [bubuKabum](https://github.com/Stefanistkuhl/bubuKabum)
- Nothing more, lol  

#### What do I want to do?  
- Play more CTFs and create a write-up repo about them  
- Build a DIY container orchestrator  
- Overengineer my emote bot with Kubernetes and deploy it on a cluster at home  
- Write more server-related docs for myself in blog form in a repo
