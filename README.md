I like to overengineer my code.  

And I might have a *small* Docker/containerization and Go addiction, but it's totally not real and nothing to worry about :3  

#### Technologies I use and like  
- Go  
  - For backend code  
- Python  
  - For small automations or general code that isn't backend  
- Java  
  - Forced by school :( 
- Docker  
  - To package my code and deploy it—I *may* have an addiction  

#### Stuff I've done  
```diff
+ Wasting time overengineering projects and adding Docker to them  
- Being actually productive  
```  
#### Ok, but what did/do I actually do?  
- Built a Discord bot with discord.js and a Go backend for handling requests (link to Bubukabum repo or something)
- Hitless Elden Ring Runs...
- Nothing more, lol  

#### What do I want to do?  
- Play more CTFs and create a write-up repo about them  
- Build a DIY container orchestrator  
- Overengineer my emote bot with Kubernetes and deploy it on a cluster at home  
- Write more server-related docs for myself in blog form in a repo  

#### Professional Java hater
- I hate Java bc:
- it Requires more lines of code.
- has higher memory consumption due to JVM.
- has slower startup compared to compiled languages.
- has complex ecosystem and libraries.
- I'm forced by school to learn it...
